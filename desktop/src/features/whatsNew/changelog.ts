/**
 * "What's new" changelog content, keyed by the app's full version string as
 * reported by `@tauri-apps/api/app`'s `getVersion()`. Append a new
 * `{version, bullets}` entry each time a release ships user-facing changes;
 * `useWhatsNewModal` picks it up automatically.
 *
 * Keyed by the whole string rather than the trailing `-N` on purpose. The
 * original scheme parsed that number and showed every entry `<= N`, which
 * broke the moment the fork rebased onto upstream 0.5.14 and the version went
 * `0.5.5-5` -> `0.5.14-0`: the counter reset to 0, no entry matched, and the
 * splash silently stopped appearing. Worse, it would have come back wrong —
 * `0.5.14-2` would have re-shown the year-old entry 2 as if it were new.
 * Array order is authoritative here, and nothing is derived from the numbers
 * inside the version string.
 *
 * The first three entries predate per-release tracking: they were splash
 * milestones bundled into this fork's first real release (`0.5.5-4`, before
 * the GitHub Actions pipeline existed), kept for continuity.
