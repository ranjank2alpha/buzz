/**
 * Drop-in replacement for `uploadMediaFile` that sends large files, video and
 * audio to the sender's Google Drive instead of the relay.
 *
 * Deliberately kept signature-compatible so `useMediaUpload` and
 * `backgroundMediaUploadStore` swap one import and keep every other behaviour
 * they already have — cancellation, progress, slot ordering, the deferred
 * video queue. The routing rule itself lives in `driveUploadRouting.mjs`, pure
 * and tested; this module is only the plumbing.
 *
 * ## Why a Drive upload still returns a `BlobDescriptor`
 *
 * It has to, to travel through the composer's attachment state unchanged. But
 * it is marked `external`, which `imetaMediaMarkdown.ts` reads to do two
 * things: emit no `imeta` tag for it, and always render it as a plain
 * `[filename](url)` link rather than an inline player.
 *
 * The result is that a Drive upload posts exactly what a person pasting a
 * labelled link would post — no fabricated `imeta` claiming a sha256 and a
 * relay blob that do not exist, and no `<video>` element pointed at a Drive
 * viewer page that will never play. The Files tab then picks it up as a link
 * entry named after the file, because `channelLinkEntries.mjs` reads the
 * markdown label. That is the whole reason no Drive API call is needed to name
 * a file Buzz itself uploaded.
 */
/**
 * Whether Drive routing is live.
 *
 * Off under e2e unless a spec asks for it, mirroring how
 * `deferredComposerUploads` is gated in `useMediaUpload`. The e2e suite has no
 * Google account, and several specs deliberately upload a 16 MB file or a video
 * to assert the *relay* path — routing those to Drive would fail them for a
 * reason that has nothing to do with what they test. The Drive path is covered
 * by unit tests over `driveUploadRouting.mjs` and, ultimately, by using it.
